# Chrome Snippets Extension Testing
test-chrome-snippets

I came across [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snippets/dcibnkkafifbanoclgjbkmkbogijndin) today and I thought I would give it a try as an alternative to my current setup. To work, the extension requires access to a public github where the snippets are to be sourced. This is a test source for my snippets.
